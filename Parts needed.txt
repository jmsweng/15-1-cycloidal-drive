Laser cut parts:
Material and thickness for all parts noted in file name, get 2x cycloidal disks made.
Use cams labeled "bigger hole" if not using the Mcmaster-carr motor that has slightly larger flats on the shaft
SendCutSend's automated quote system doesn't like some of the .step files for some parts and some .dxf files for others. Use the following files if purchasing from SCS
	DXF:	cycloidal disk, input eccentric cam, input concentric cam, input eccentric cam, gearbox output bearing plate, output hub plate 3
	STEP:	gearbox base, gearbox pin retaining plate, output hub plate 1, output hub plate 2
Double that part sizes are correct/in correct units before ordering:
	cams should be about 20mm/0.79in 
	hub plates are about 65mm/2.6in
	gearbox plates should be about 95mm/3.74 in 
	cycloidal disk should be about 73mm
Gearbox base needs four M4 tapped holes, see part drawings folder
Gearbox output bearing plate has two options, one has countersunk holes so that screw heads are flush, one does not

3D printed parts:
Step files for all printed parts are included and should be able to be imported directly to slicer. The spacers are all in the step files in the quantity needed.
Motor to gearbox spacer may need to have dimensions adjusted if using a motor with a different length shaft.
		
Bearings:
Bearings are crazy expensive from mcmaster-carr
All bearings should be rubber sealed
