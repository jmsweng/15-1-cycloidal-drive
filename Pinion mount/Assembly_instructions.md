## Assembly instructions:

### Top arm
The motor mounting holes on the top arm are undersized due to laser cutting requirements and are ~5.7 mm as manufactured. Drill the four following holes below out to fit M6 screws, a ¼” (6.35 mm) drill bit should work for this. Holes are highlighted in blue.

Shown below is the view of the top of the top arm component.

![Top arm component, top view](Pictures/Top%20arm.png)

Place the part with the top face facing down onto a flat surface so that it looks like the view shown below.

![Top arm, bottom view](Pictures/Top%20arm%20bottom%20view.png)

Clean highlighted hole before proceeding. Also clean the outside of the 6301 bearing, but try to avoid getting cleaner inside of the bearing. Wiping surfaces with solvent such as acetone or alcohol should be sufficient. 
Make sure parts are dry before proceeding. Apply retaining compound to the inside of the highlighted hole and press in the 6301 ball bearing in from the top. This should press in relatively easy, but use an arbor press or other tool if necessary. The top surface of the ball bearing should be flush with the top surface of the plate. The top surface of the plate is facing down in the illustration below. Retaining compound should start hardening in ~10 minutes and reaches full strength in 24 hours.

Lightly sand the highlighted portion of the tensioning spring tab that is threaded for M10 holes to prepare for gluing. Clean surface and allow to dry before gluing.

Ensure highlighted mating surfaces are clean before proceeding. Top surface of the plate is now facing up in the illustrations. Note the position of the bearing, it should be flush with the top.

Apply epoxy or other adhesive to surfaces and press tab in from the top so that the assembly looks like below. Clean off any excess epoxy before drying.

### Base plate
Shown below is the top view of the base plate component.

Repeat previous procedure to install 6301 bearing in the highlighted hole. The bearing should be flush with the bottom surface of the base plate:

![Base plate bearing insertion](Pictures/Base%20plate%20bearing%20insertion.png)

Lightly sand the highlighted portion of the tensioning spring tab that is not threaded for M10 holes to prepare for gluing. Clean surface and allow to dry before gluing.

Ensure highlighted mating surfaces are clean before proceeding.

Apply epoxy or other adhesive to surfaces and press tab in from the top so that the assembly looks like below. Clean off any excess epoxy before drying.

### Hinge assembly
Once epoxy is cured on both parts, assemble the top arm and base plate as shown below. Parts highlighted in blue are the M16 button head screw, bearing spacer, and M16 nut. Apply thread locker to hold the nut on to the M16 screw. Recommend Loctite 242 or 243. Wicking thread locker such as Loctite 290 is also fine if part is already assembled. If wicking thread locker is used apply at position indicated by green arrow in illustration.

### Tensioning spring installation
Insert tensioning screws, washer, tensioning spring, and washer into tensioning tab holes as shown below. Tensioning screws are M10 x 220mm partially threaded hex cap screws. Washers are M10 washers. Springs are 0.75” OD x 0.48” ID x 3” springs, McMaster-Carr part #9657K438. 

![Tensioning spring installation](Pictures/Tensioning%20spring%20installation.png)

After installation, screws should be tensioned such that the distance from the face of the tensioning tab to the bottom of the hex cap screw is ~66 mm (as shown below on the pink spacer). This distance is not super critical, if using the tensioning screws and springs in the original spec it should not be possible to tighten them down such that the pinion will not be able to skip out of the rack before the max rated force is exceeded.
